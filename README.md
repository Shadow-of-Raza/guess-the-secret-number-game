# guess-the-secret-number-game
Guess the Secret Number is a fun and interactive number-guessing game where players try to find the hidden number between 1 and 100 within 5 attempts. After each guess, the game provides helpful hints — letting you know whether your guess is too high or too low — and visually updates a colorful number board. Numbers that are no longer possible turn red, while the correct answer glows green when discovered.

A dynamic popup displays your final result — win or lose — with an option to play again. The game also includes sound effects and confetti animations to celebrate your victory, creating an engaging and rewarding experience.

This game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, combining clean UI design, interactive animations, and logical game functionality to deliver a smooth browser-based gaming experience.
